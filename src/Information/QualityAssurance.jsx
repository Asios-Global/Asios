      IT'S A MATTER OF TRUST, So Asios will inspect raw
      materials and components before final production begins with inputs
      provided by customer. After tiles samples are provided, we will
      verify that the factory has ordered the correct materials,
      components, and accessories. We will also randomly select and
      inspect a sample of partially produced tile boxes for potential
      defects such as: Technical Standards, Dimension and Physical
      Properties, Surface Flatness (Planarity), Thickness, Length and Wide
      (Size), Straightness of Sides, Surface Quality, Water Absorption
      Breaking Strength And Modulus Of Rupture, Chemical Resistance, Stain
      Resistance, Thermal Shock, Deep Abrasion Resistance, Crazing
      Resistance, Frost Resistance, Glossiness And Texture Packaging
      Specifications like Bar Code Label Standard, Wood Pallet Standard
      Dimension, Pallet Wrapping Standard, Loading Instruction and Some
      Details Need Lab Testing Then report our findings to you. If
      necessary, we can provide the factory with the technical advice
      necessary to improve tiles quality and to minimize the chance of
      defects during production.

            During Production Inspections are ideal for shipments of substantial
            quantities product lines with continuous production, strict
            requirements for on-time shipments and as a follow up if poor
            results were found during Pre Production Inspection. Normally,
            During Production Inspections are carried out when 12-15% of the
            merchandise is completed. Asios will inspect the
            production batch and examine tiles in the line for possible defects.
            At this point we will identify deviations, if any, and offer advice
            on corrective measures that will ensure uniformity of tiles and
            quality. We will also re-check any defects discovered during
            Pre-Production Inspection and confirm that they have been rectified.

      Pre Shipment called Final Random Inspections can begin only after
      production has been completed and all production is ready and packed
      for shipment. Through a statistical method set by industry
      standards, we will sample products to verify product safety,
      quantity, workmanship, function, color, size, packing, and more.
      This ensures that your product is consistent and compliant with all
      country, industry, or otherwise specified requirements and that no
      critical major or minor defects appear.

            tape as proof of compliance. This service significantly reduces the
